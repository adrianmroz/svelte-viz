## Primitives for Data visualisation in Svelte

### Very Work in progress

### Roadmap

* `ColumnFrame` and `GridFrame`
* Implement as many non-geo viz from Data Viz Handbook as possible
* Operators for `Scene` (`split`, `inset`, `stack` ... ) 
* `ResponsiveScene` should handle `left` / `right` / `top` / `bottom` props
* Clean up handling context in `Scene` components (Wrapper ?)
* Fix types for `deepMap`
* Implement some very basic Guides
* `AnimatedFrame`s where values are represented as `spring`s
* `Frame` for layouts like Marimeko or Treemap
* Explore `selection` ideas from vega
